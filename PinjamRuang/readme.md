PinjamRuang is a web-based application that aims to facilitate the booking of spaces in Berijalan. <br />
The expectation of this application is able to provide convenience to employees who want to use the space facilities that have been provided 
without the need to spend time for accommodation to meet personally or contact the administration personally to make an appointment and 
become the main portal for employees to book a space to support their work activities.

This application is divided into two sides, the User and the admin or Content Management Systems (CMS).
Both are built using the same platform (OutSystems 11), but have their own customized look and functionality.

PinjamRuang users have several main functions, including registration, login, borrowing space, 
and viewing borrowing history and including the home, space gallery, about us, and contact us pages.

On the User side, CMS has the main functions including approval or rejection of room borrowing by the PinjamRuang User. 
In addition to its main functions, the CMS includes managing rooms, managing PinjamRuang Users, managing CMS Users, viewing the loan list, 
and changing User passwords.
